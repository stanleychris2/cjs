Chris Stanley

I'm based in San Francisco and am currently the founder of an AI startup, Patterns, building deep research agents for private equity investing. 

Before Patterns I founded a marketplace, Scope, (https://www.scopeinc.com/blog/announcing-our-2-25m-series-seed) and was an early employee at fintech Cover (https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/02/cover-insurance/) startups. In 2016, I joined the business operations team at Square (nee Block) to help scale risk and fraud detection systems, and in 2011 I started my career as a sell-side investment banker at Nomura Securities, covering hedge funds for fixed income products.

I went to Yale where I doubled majored in economics and psychology, and started on the varsity football and track and field teams - https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/YALE-Despite-his-track-record-Stanley-s-a-11605894.php
