          <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-800">
            <p>In technology, leverage compounds where scarcity exists. For the last two decades, software was scarce. It was expensive to build, hard to distribute, and even harder to maintain. This scarcity created enormous opportunity—for founders, investors, and especially for private equity.</p>
            <p>But we are now entering an era where <strong>software is no longer scarce</strong>. The emergence of generative AI—through tools like Cursor, Claude, GPT-4o, and others—has dramatically compressed the cost of software creation. What once required teams of engineers can now be prototyped and deployed by an individual over a weekend.</p>
            <p>This transformation has profound implications, but perhaps nowhere more acutely than in <strong>private equity</strong>. PE, by design, is a machine for exploiting structural inefficiencies. If those inefficiencies change, the machine must adapt.</p>
            <p>We are approaching a new equilibrium—one where software is abundant, and <strong>scarcity shifts elsewhere</strong>. This piece is about where that scarcity is moving, and what it means for PE investors in the years ahead.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold pt-4">Software as the New Content</h2>
            <p>The best historical analogy isn’t SaaS—it’s media.</p>
            <p>Just as the internet turned video content from something only studios could afford to produce into something anyone could upload from their phone, AI is turning software from a capital-intensive asset into a generative output. A YouTube for code is forming—only this time, the creators are agents.</p>
            <p>In media, this led to a collapse of the cable bundle. The value of individual channels dropped. Distribution unbundled. Attention fragmented. The traditional model of scarcity—owning the pipe and controlling the programming—gave way to a model of abundance, where success came from aggregation, recommendation, and data.</p>
            <p>That same transformation is now beginning in software.</p>
            <p>What used to be defensible—having a product at all—is no longer enough. In a world of infinite software, <strong>the bottleneck is no longer supply. It is distribution, data, and integration</strong>.</p>
